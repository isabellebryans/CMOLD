# To do:
# - can't capture king -> done
# Piece promotion
# captured piece -> done
# if piece is captured, must be other colour to capturer (need sparql)

# Knowing
# BS + PI + status + move + deleted triple from graph
# !!! Board status is the status before the adding and deletion of triples is carried out !!!

# Can validate:
# Move is valid
# same as CR, and that if a piece is captured, it is out of the game (then two triples to add and delete)

# find out what was moved
# General move
# the piece moved must adhere to exactly one of the piece move shapes
